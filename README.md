# UNP_PROJECT_BI_WITH_MS_EXCEL_CUSTOMER_CREDIT_CARD_DATA
The dataset contains detailed information on 3,201 credit card customers, aimed at analyzing customer demographics, financial status, and employment background. Each record includes key attributes such as gender, age (in years and categorized age range), number of children, and total number of family members. Financial information is provided through fields like total income, type of income, and length of employment, expressed both in days and years. Customers asset ownership is represented by indicators of whether they own a car or real estate, and their housing type. Additionally, the dataset includes communication flags to indicate whether customers have access to mobile phones, work phones, home phones, and email. The employment-related information is complemented by occupation types, giving further insight into customer profiles.
This dataset was utilized in a UNP Education project where I collaborated with a team to analyze credit card customer data using Microsoft Excel. We began by cleaning and organizing the raw data, followed by applying filters and formatting techniques to improve readability and usability. Using pivot tables and charts, we identified significant customer trends and behavioral patterns. This project allowed me to demonstrate strong analytical skills and effective teamwork in deriving actionable insights from complex data.
